There is a sample bot in src/com/barracuda/contest2013/ContestBot.java.

You'll want to update the handleMessage() method, or create a subclass and
override the handleMessage() method.

Presumably you'll be using Eclipse or another IDE for java development, but if
not, a build.xml file is provided, you can compile the source and create a
runnable jar file by issuing the ant command in the current directory. Note
that you'll probably want to remove the -nowarn compiler flag from build.xml
for your own code.

$ ant

This will produce ContestBot.jar. You can then run the application from
command line:

// test with test server
$ java -jar ContestBot.jar cuda.contest 19999

// test online with other players
$ java -jar ContestBot.jar cuda.contest 9999


To remove build remnants and the jarfile:

$ ant clean
